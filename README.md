#Dynamic Assessment Database System for Mental Health of Vulnerable Children Based on Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Perception
The present invention relates to a dynamic assessment database system for the mental health of vulnerable children based on multimodal artificial intelligence perception, named the "Phoenix Butterfly Heart" Database. The core database is constructed through meta-analysis to form an accurate assessment system. This technology integrates multimodal intelligent technologies such as speech emotion recognition, micro-expression capture, and text semantic analysis to collect information. It converts the physiological signals, behavioral trajectories, and psychological characteristics of vulnerable children into quantitative assessment dimensions, thereby realizing the accurate assessment of mental health status, the delineation of risk levels, and the exploration of group psychological needs. By integrating multi-dimensional perception technology and AI cognitive models, the "Phoenix Butterfly Heart" Database of the present invention significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of mental health detection, and provides strong technical support for the mental health screening, early warning, monitoring and precise intervention of vulnerable children.
